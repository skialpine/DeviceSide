# Integrations

What the [README](../README.md) features do on every integration, and what none can do. Each integration has its own
page, with its limits and what DeviceSide changes in your setup: [Shelly](integrations/shelly/index.md),
[Zigbee2MQTT](integrations/zigbee2mqtt/index.md), [ZHA](integrations/zha/index.md),
[Matter](integrations/matter/index.md), [Hue](integrations/hue/index.md) and
[Control4](integrations/control4/index.md). Which devices each feature is proven on
is on the [device compatibility page](device-compatibility.md). How the commands work on the wire, and what was
measured on real bulbs, is in [internals.md](internals.md) and each integration's own.

## All integrations

- **Refused targets.** A target that can't take an action fails the call if you named it, and is skipped if it
  came through an area, device, label or group ([action-behavior.md](action-behavior.md)). The error names the
  reason, such as `capability_not_tested`.
- **Groups.** For timers and smooth moves, Zigbee2MQTT and ZHA groups and Hue rooms and zones get one
  command, so their lights move together. `set_attributes` writes a ZHA group's or Hue room's lights one by one.
  Any other group, such as a light group helper, is expanded and each light gets its own command.
- **Switches shown as lights.** A light made from a supported switch with Home Assistant's "Change device type of a
  switch" helper is treated as that switch: light fields are dropped and the timer still runs. An inverted one is
  refused (`inverted_wrapper`).
- **No color temperature moves.** Every stop of a color temperature fade on a Hue bulb, the Hue bridge's own
  included, makes a visible jump, so there is no raise or lower for it.
- **Fades pick up where the last one stopped.** DeviceSide remembers each raise, lower and `stop` for a few
  seconds after it ends (2 s on Zigbee, 15 s on Hue), so releasing and pressing again doesn't jump. A light
  command from Home Assistant clears it at once; a change from a remote or app in that window may be missed.
- **Dimming to 0 % is a soft off.** The light fades out and keeps its level, so a plain turn on brings it back
  there. Raising brightness on a light that is off fades in from the bottom.

## What can't be done, and why

The README's prohibited signs mark these. Each is a limit of the device protocol or the bridge, not a feature
waiting to be built.

- **Turn off with timer on ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT and Matter.** The Zigbee and Matter timer command (`OnWithTimedOff`)
  turns a device on, then off. There is no command for off, then on.
- **Turn on or off with timer on Hue.** The bridge's own timers keep running through a plain on or off, from Home
  Assistant, the Hue app or a dimmer switch, and the Hue app doesn't show them. To time Hue bulbs, pair them with
  ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT or Matter.
- **Smooth hue change on Hue.** A trip around the color wheel isn't a straight line the bridge can fade along.
  Smooth saturation changes work.

## Zigbee plugs and switches

`turn_on_for` and `get_attributes` on Zigbee2MQTT and ZHA plugs and switches are untested
([device compatibility](device-compatibility.md#zigbee-plugs-and-switches)). Few honor the Zigbee timer command:
IKEA's are moving to Thread, and Sonoff and Tuya run their own countdowns (the Tuya TS011F tested never switches on).
If you try one, please report it whether it works or not: Integrations >
[DeviceSide](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=deviceside) > Configure > Report a device test
result or bug, which prefills the device's details.
